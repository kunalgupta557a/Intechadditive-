f) Dot product and cross product

dot and cross product both are multiplication but the dot product only have magnitude no direction while cross product have both
example:-
lets say when we dot product two force or energy vectors
we will find the magnitude of impact they will together have on a object

while cross product will tell you the magnitude in each direction
so dot product can be used to calculate normal momenteum or energy or finding hypotenuse in traingle
while cross product used to find rotation or angular momentum
